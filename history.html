            <h2>History</h2>

            <h3>2005–06: Formation and earlier days</h3>
            <p>The foundation for One OK Rock began when Toru Yamashita, then a high school student, wanted to start a
                band. He told his friend Ryota Kohama, a fellow member of the hip hop dance group Heads, to learn the
                bass and asked Alex Onizawa, who was their senior in school to join. He asked his classmate, Yu, to play
                drums. At that time, Taka Moriuchi was playing with another band named Chivalry of Music; however, Taka
                didn't enjoy playing with them, so Toru insisted that he join One OK Rock instead. After signing with
                Amuse, Inc. Yu left the band to pursue an acting career and his parents didn't want their son to pursue
                that line of work. Tomoya Kanki had been teaching at ESP (Musical Academy) and was already in a band
                that wasn't going well. He then joined One OK Rock in 2006, but only became an official member when they
                debuted in 2007.</p>

            <h3>2007–09: Early releases and departure of Onizawa</h3>
            <p>Their debut single, "Naihishinsho", reached number 48 on the Oricon Charts and sold 15,000 copies. Their
                second single, Yume Yume, followed that success and charted at number 43. After those singles, they
                released their debut album Zeitakubyō in 2007 and had their first tour, the Tokyo-Osaka-Nagoya Quattro
                Tour. They released their second album Beam of Light in May 2008. In an interview with Rockin'On Japan
                magazine in June 2012, One OK Rock said they didn't count this album as an album, but rather as a part
                of growing up as a band. When they made the album, they hadn't been in the right mood, but felt that
                they had to make it to grow as a band. The band came up with many sound sources and ended up making a
                punk album. The album's confused origins were the reason why they wouldn't play any songs from Beam of
                Light in live performances until now. Shortly after releasing Beam of Light, they performed a gig at
                Shibuya AX.</p>

            <p>They had planned to release two albums in that one year, so they released Kanjō Effect in November 2008.
                At this point, the band had gained more experience and were able to do some more serious recording. They
                settled into the western sound they loved and followed by replacing all their engineers and introducing
                their music to new producers. This led to some division within the band - Taka and Alex in particular
                disagreed about how to make this album.</p>

            <p>On April 5, 2009, Alex was arrested for groping the leg of a twenty-one-year-old female student on a
                train. He admitted to the charges and the case was settled out of court. The band reached their weakest
                point at this time. Ryota intended to leave bass and take up guitar. They felt it was impossible for
                them to add a new member. The band's next single "Around the World Shounen", which was planned for a May
                6 release and to be used as the theme song for the TV drama God Hand Teru, and their nationwide tour
                were both cancelled. In May 2009, it was announced that One OK Rock would continue on without Alex, who
                went back to the United States. Toru took his place as lead guitar, and the band re-arranged their songs
                to be played for one guitar.</p>

            <h3>2010–12: Niche Syndrome and Zankyo Reference</h3>
            <p>With the new four-member formation, the band released the single "Kanzen Kankaku Dreamer" on February 3,
                2010. It reached 9th on the Weekly Oricon Chart. They released their fourth studio album titled Niche
                Syndrome on June 9, 2010. The band had their tour This is my own judgement! in five Zepp music halls
                across the nation in 6 days, starting Sendai, Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka and ending in a 2-day concert in
                Tokyo. The second part the tour took place at sixteen different venues until 11 December 2010. They held
                a final performance in Nippon Budokan, Tokyo on 28 November, followed by the release of a concert DVD
                "This is My Budokan?!" on 16 February 2011. On August 6, 7 and 8, One OK Rock headlined Rock in Japan

                took place in six Zepp music halls and three other venues from April to June 2011. The band released
                their first double A-side single "Re:make/No Scared" on July 20, 2011, one of which's songs was the main
                theme for the Black Rock Shooter: The Game video game. The band's fifth album, Zankyo Reference, was
                released on October 5, 2011. One OK Rock announced fourteen dates between November and December 2011 for
